  1. FIRST CLONE THE REPO LOCALLY IN YOUR PC AND OPEN THE PROJECT USING ON YOUR TEXT EDITOR TYPE `npm install` IN YOUR TERMINAL .
  2. NOW TYPE `cd frontend` AND AGAIN TYPE `npm install` IN YOUR TERMINAL, THIS WILL INSTALL ALL THE DEPENDENCIES NEEDED FOR THE PROJECT TO RUN.
  3. NOW AGAIN GO BACK TO THE HOME DIRECTORY OF YOUR PROJECT BY USING `cd ..` AND TYPE `npm start` THIS WILL START THE BACKEND SERVER .
  4. NOW OPEN POWERSHELL IN WINDOWS AND RUN MONGOD.EXE BY SPECIFYING ITS LOCATION AND ALSO THE DB PATH FOR EX: `/Users/Ashutosh/mongodb/bin/mongod.exe --dbpath=/Users/Ashutosh/mongodb-data`. SIMILIARLY YOU CAN ALSO RUN MONGODB SERVER BY SPECIFYING THE LOCATION IN YOUR POWERSHELL OR TERMINAL.
  5. AFTER THIS COMMAND YOUR LOCAL MONGODB SERVER WOULD START RUNNING AT PORT 27017.
  6. NOW OPEN ANOTHER TERMINAL WHERE YOU NAVIGATE TO FRONTEND SECTION BY USING `cd frontend` and run the command `npm start` THIS WILL START THE REACT SERVER AND YOUR WEBSITE WOULD BE OPENED AT `localhost:3000`.
